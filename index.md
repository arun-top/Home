## About Me

Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at IISER Mohali.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **algebraic topology** and **algebraic geometry**. I use the framework of **motivic homotopy theory** created by Morel and Voevodsky to study the various invariants that come up in the study of solutions to polynomial equations, with a special focus on **algebraic K-theory**.
